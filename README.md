# vkcomRequests
# Just trying to send some requests to vk.com to perform basic tasks:
*   Sending Messages
*   Making text post on your wall
*   Deleting posts on the wall
*   Tried to implement some automated reply but got stuck on figuring out values of:
** hashes for different requests(hash)
*** not sure which function and what is input data but you can check hashes in renderd HTML pages in browser
** timestamps (ts)
### Approach I took was checking "Network" tab in the browser while completing different actions on the page and trying to repeat them with session methods
### Be careful about your personal data
###### im not careful at all
